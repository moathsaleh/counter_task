## Explanation of the code:

### State Management:
The `useState` hook is used to create a state variable `counter` and its updater function `setCounter`. The initial state of `counter` is set to 0.

### Callback Functions:
Two callback functions, `plus` and `minus`, are defined using the `useCallback` hook. These functions use the updater function form of `setCounter` to correctly update the state based on the previous state.

### Render Logic:
The main JSX structure renders a container (`main`) with a flex layout. Inside this container, a row (`flex-row`) with space between items (`justify-between`) is created to house the buttons and the counter display.

### Buttons and Interaction:
Two clickable `div` elements act as buttons for incrementing (+) and decrementing (-) the counter. They invoke the `plus` and `minus` callback functions when clicked.

### Styling:
Tailwind CSS classes are used for styling, such as setting the width of the container to 24 units (`w-24`). The `cursor-pointer` class is added to make the buttons visually clickable.

Remember to have the necessary dependencies installed, including React and TypeScript, for this code to work correctly. This simple application provides a basic example of using React and TypeScript to manage state and handle user interactions.
